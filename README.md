# Cuttlefacts (with Argo)

This is a companion to [squaremo/cuttlefacts](https://github.com/squaremo/cuttlefacts/), using [Argo kit](https://github.com/argoproj/) instead of Tekton to drive application delivery pipelines. [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux) is still used to bootstrap the infrastructure.

# Cuttlefacts infrastructure (with Argo)

This is a companion to
[cuttlefacts/cuttlefacts](https://github.com/cuttlefacts/cuttlefacts/),
using [Argo kit](https://github.com/argoproj/) instead of Tekton to
drive application delivery
pipelines. [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux) is still used to
bootstrap the infrastructure.
